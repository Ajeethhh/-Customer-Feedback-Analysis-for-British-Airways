I have grouped the reviews based on the ratings as such the first set containing 1-3 rating, the second set containing 4-7 rating and the last one containing 8-10 rating. Then I proceeded as making it as a single para and then I splitted the words. I then passed those splitted words into a lkist and have appended it only if the words aren't in the stopwords. Then I called upon the ngrams function from the nltk library to split the text into sequences of words. Each sequence contained the number of words specified by number_of_ngrams.To identify the most frequently occurring n-grams, I utilized the FreqDist function, which counted how often each n-gram appeared. I then selected the top 50 most common n-grams for deeper analysis. And then I converted the n-gram words and the frequencies into a dataframe using the pandas library, creating a clear and structured format for your data. To ensure the most common n-grams appeared at the top, I sorted the dataframe by the frequency of the n-grams. Since n-grams were initially tuples of words, I joined the words in each n-gram with underscores, converting them into readable strings.The final step was to visualize the frequency of these n-grams for which I used the seaborn library to create a bar plot. From the above three bar plots the employees of the BA can understand the areas service where the service is lacking and the areas where they're strong and could improve them.
